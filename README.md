# Personal Projects:

This repository showcases a collection of my personal tech projects and experiments. Most of the work here is built using Python, covering areas like automation, scripting, and small applications that help me learn and explore new concepts. Alongside coding, I’ve also taken on hands-on projects like building a custom PC and creating content around it, reflecting my broader interest in technology and hardware. This space is a work-in-progress portfolio of what I’ve learned and what I’m continuing to explore as I grow my skills.
